1)
The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.
No rounding or formatting is necessary.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a//b)
    print(a/b)

2)
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
ans)-
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a+b)
    print(a-b)
    print(a*b)
